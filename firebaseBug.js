The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the data retrieved from the database is unexpectedly structured or contains invalid data types. For example, attempting to access a property of an object that does not exist, or parsing data of a type other than what is expected will cause runtime errors. This is particularly common when dealing with nested data or data that is dynamically generated.
